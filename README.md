- ### **Sprint Review**: 
    - Although we struggled to keep up with the ideal curve on the burndown chart, we managed to achieve our target points by the end of the sprint.
     - In this sprint, we completed the basics of:
        - Coding the main game mechanic of character transformation, including models and animations;
        - Scoring and mechanism for progressing to the next level;
        - Design of the tutorial level
    - Due to the religous holiday at the start of the bootcamp, we had difficulties communicating with team members and scheduling meetings at a convenient time for everyone, which slowed us down.
    - Initially, we planned for our character to transform into chameleon, mouse, monkey, and kangaroo/rabbit. However, due to the limited assets available in the bootcamp and the lack of a team member dedicated to design tasks, we decided to use turtle instead of chameleon, and beaver instead of mouse.
    - We encountered difficulties in adjusting the URP settings for the portal used to transition between levels.
    - Although we set up the level scoring system, we couldn’t test it comprehensively as only the tutorial level was ready.
    - Due to some differences in the Firebase system between desktop and Android, we decided to postpone Firebase rlated tasks to the second sprint.
    - Despite our lack of experience in 3D game development and the absence of a designer in the team, we managed to achieve our overall goals in this sprint.
    - **Sprint Review Participants:** `Aziz Önder`, `Ayberk Yaşar`, `Beyza Özkan`

- ### **Sprint Retrospective:**
    - Due to communication issues within the team, it was decided to create a WhatsApp group, in addition to the Discord server, to ensure more effective communication in the next sprint.
    - Due to the lack of a designer, it was decided that Ayberk and Aziz would work on finding suitable assets and level design.
    - It was emphasized that team members should be more active and open to communication in future sprints.
